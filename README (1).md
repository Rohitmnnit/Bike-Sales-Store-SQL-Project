# Unveiling the Power of Data with SQL: Bike Sales Analysis

In this project, I used SQL to dive deep into a comprehensive dataset of bike sales, uncovering valuable insights into store performance, customer behavior, and product metrics. The analysis covers a range of aspects including store details, top customers, total revenue, staff information, brand performance, and order specifics.

## Key Insights:

#### Store Performance: 
Identified the store with the highest variety of products in stock.

#### Customer Analysis: 
Highlighted the top 5 customers based on the total revenue generated from their orders.

#### Product Insights: 
Analyzed the total revenue and discount applied to each product, revealing the most and least profitable items.

#### Staff Efficiency: 
Evaluated staff members' performance, particularly those who handled the most orders.

## SQL Challenges Tackled:

#### Basic Queries: 

Listing cities, retrieving product details, and identifying active staff members.

#### Moderate Challenges: 
Calculating total revenue per product, listing product quantities per store, and identifying staff who are also managers.

#### Advanced Analysis: 
Determining the store with the highest product variety, products with the highest discounts, and the average quantity of products ordered per order.

## Results:

Enhanced understanding of revenue distribution across different products and stores.

Improved inventory management by identifying high-performing stores and products.

Streamlined customer engagement strategies by pinpointing top customers.
